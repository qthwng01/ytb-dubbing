1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:05,600
I'm going to give you over 10 years of web design knowledge in just 7 minutes.

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:08,100
No fluff, just the good stuff.

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:09,000
Are you ready?

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:09,800
Let's go.

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:18,300
You can basically boil all the design knowledge that you need to build great websites down to just three things.

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,400
Layout, color, and typography.

7
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:27,900
Probably heard it said before that people read or engage websites in somewhat of an F pattern.

8
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:36,600
So they start reading at the top left and then they go right, they come back, they go down on the left, they go right, they come back and they go down on the left until they're done.

9
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:38,200
But here's the truth.

10
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,500
That's actually bogus.

11
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:46,600
It's outdated information that web designers just kind of keep repeating, and so everybody thinks it's true.

12
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:51,200
I might have been one of those web designers, and for that I apologize.

13
00:00:51,201 --> 00:01:03,600
The truth is, is that people engage with websites and all sorts of different patterns, and forcing them to pay attention in an F pattern might actually cause them to miss important information.

14
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,400
So what do you do instead?

15
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:08,500
You use something called visual hierarchy.

16
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:18,200
Probably seen an image before where there's this big bold line of text that says you're going to read this first, and the smaller line underneath it that says then you'll read it next.

17
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:26,000
And then this really tiny line that's all the way in the left hand corner that says, and you'll read this last, that is visual hierarchy.

18
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:30,400
You make the most important elements of a section, the biggest and the boldest.

19
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:36,200
And then for each other element that isn't maybe as important, you turn down the volume.

20
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:40,700
You make it more inconspicuous for your call to action or buttons.

21
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:45,400
You want to make sure that they have a high degree of contrast from everything else around them.

22
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:45,800
Why?

23
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:50,300
Because the main thing we want people to do on a website is click a button.

24
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,500
If it doesn't stand out, it's going to make it harder to do that.

25
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,400
And please, I beg of you, stop using ghost buttons.

26
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:58,500
What are ghost buttons?

27
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:02,400
They're buttons that just have an outline without a solid background.

28
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:06,600
The problem is that people don't see them and they don't click on them.

29
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:12,700
For colors, every website should have a color palette that matches the brand of the website owner.

30
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:15,900
Here's a few important things to consider when it comes to color.

31
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,500
The first thing is accessibility.

32
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:27,600
If you pick colors that make it difficult to read text or tough to see elements clearly, it's going to be hard for users to engage.

33
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:35,900
You want to pick colors that have a high enough contrast that even users with visual impairments are still going to be able to see things clearly.

34
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:38,600
How do you know if a contrast is high enough?

35
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:42,600
Something that I like using is a website calledcoolers.co.

36
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:48,200
You could actually take all of the brand colors from a website and put it into the dashboard.

37
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:56,000
Click on the color contrast teller and it will instantly tell you which colors pass and which super helpful tool.

38
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:02,500
Another good rule of thumb for colors is that you want to use a guideline called the 6030 ten rule.

39
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:10,200
Basically what this means is that about 60% of your website should use your dominant colors, things like Grays or blacks and whites.

40
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:18,200
30% you should reserve for your brand colors, and then another 10% you want to use something for an accent.

41
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,500
So helping things really stand out.

42
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:25,300
That's a great thing to use for, like your calls to actions or your buttons.

43
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:29,300
Is this a hard and fast rule that you absolutely have to use every single time?

44
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,500
No, but it's a good principle to stick with, especially when you're first getting started.

45
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,600
Then there's typography.

46
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:43,900
Typography is one of the most underrated design elements of a website, but it has a massive impact on the readability and user experience.

47
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:47,200
Thankfully, there's a ton of great options when it comes to fonts.

48
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:56,800
You've got serifs, you've got sans serifs, you've got handwritten fonts, You've got scripts, you've got display, you've got monospace, and it goes on and on.

49
00:03:56,801 --> 00:04:00,000
There are three main text elements to consider for your website.

50
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:07,000
You've got your H ones or your main headers, and this should be the biggest, most prominent text on the page.

51
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:10,300
This is going to describe what the entire page is all about.

52
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,800
Then you've got your H2 or your subheadings.

53
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:19,399
These act as ways to divvy up the rest of the page and guide a user's attention.

54
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,000
Then finally you've got your paragraph text or your P tags.

55
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,900
You don't want to use really decorative text for this.

56
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,800
It might look cool, but it kills readability.

57
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,700
But here's the thing.

58
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:35,000
Good design without good conversion practices doesn't actually help your clients.

59
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:41,000
I designed a website a while back for a client and the result was way better than their old website.

60
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,300
It was clean, it was modern, it was chef's kiss.

61
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:47,500
The problem was, when we launched it, sales plummeted.

62
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:48,800
Why did that happen?

63
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:54,300
It's because I tried to make it look pretty instead of focusing on good conversion practice.

64
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:59,000
If your design doesn't consider conversion, it's useless to your clients.

65
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,300
So what are good conversion practices?

66
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,000
Good conversion is all about reducing friction for users.

67
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:14,100
You want to make it stupid easy for the users to find what they're looking for and to go through and either buy a product or sign up for a service.

68
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,900
And that's done through clarity.

69
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:23,200
You want to be crystal clear about who the company is or the person is, who owns the website, and what the user is supposed to do next.

70
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:26,700
Why they should even You also do it through scan ability.

71
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:30,100
People aren't reading websites, they're scanning through it.

72
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:35,000
So you need to set things out in such a way that people can bounce around and make decisions.

73
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,200
And then finally, you want the website to be motivating.

74
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:40,000
It's not just enough to be pretty.

75
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:43,100
You actually need to speak to the heart of the user.

76
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:46,800
Speak to the thing that's driving them to say yes or no.

77
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:52,800
But overall, you want to design for the right audience, not for yourself and not for your client.

78
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,700
It doesn't matter if you love the design.

79
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:57,600
It doesn't even matter if your client loves the design.

80
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:59,400
Who does it matter for?

81
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:00,900
The website visitors.

82
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,300
So do a little research.

83
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,600
Who's actually using this website.

84
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,400
Fonts, colors, layout.

85
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:10,300
Choose them based on the target audience and not personal preference.

86
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,600
Finally, make sure that you never stop learning.

87
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:15,200
Web designers don't age like fine wine, OK?

88
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,600
We age like a loaf of bread left on the counter.

89
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,400
We go stale unless we keep learning.

90
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:25,100
The web design industry is changing fast, and it's going to continue to do so.

91
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:28,300
What worked just five years ago might not work today.

92
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:31,000
It might not work in the next five years.

93
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:35,100
And if you don't challenge yourself and stay updated, you're going to fall behind.

94
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,800
Will AI take all of our jobs?

95
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:39,900
Probably not.

96
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:43,400
But will AI take lazy web designer jobs?

97
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,600
Absolutely.

98
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:49,900
The only way to stay valuable is to keep learning, keep adjusting, and keep leveling up.

99
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:55,800
And you might be asking yourself, that's all well and good, but what do I need to do if I'm getting started today?

100
00:06:55,901 --> 00:07:01,200
Thankfully, I've got another video that I'm going to link to that's going to answer just those questions.

101
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:06,800
Make sure that you like this video if it was helpful, and be sure to subscribe so that you don't miss another episode.

102
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,700
And don't forget, if you don't quit, you win.
